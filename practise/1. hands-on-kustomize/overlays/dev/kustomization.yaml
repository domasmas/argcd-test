# This is the Kustomization file for the DEV environment overlay
# An overlay inherits from a base and applies environment-specific customizations
# This allows you to have one base configuration and multiple environment variations

# API version for Kustomize configuration files
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1

# Kind specifies this is a Kustomization resource
kind: Kustomization

# Resources section points to the base configuration that this overlay inherits from
resources:
  # This includes all resources defined in the base kustomization
  # Everything from base/kustomization.yaml will be inherited here
  - ../../base

# CommonLabels automatically adds these labels to ALL resources in this kustomization
# This is useful for identifying which environment resources belong to
# These labels will be added to metadata.labels of every resource
commonLabels:
  # Environment label - useful for filtering resources by environment
  env: dev
  # Team label - useful for identifying which team owns these resources
  team: developers

# NamePrefix adds a prefix to the name of ALL resources
# This helps avoid naming conflicts between environments
# For example, "my-config" becomes "dev-my-config"
namePrefix: dev-

# Patches section allows you to modify specific parts of the base resources
# This is where environment-specific changes are applied
patches:
  # Path points to a patch file that contains the modifications
  # The patch.yaml file will contain instructions on how to modify the base resources
  - path: patch.yaml
