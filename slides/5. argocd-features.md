# 🥑 How Argo CD Works & Key Features

A Deep Dive into Argo CD's Capabilities

---

# 🔄 The Core Engine: Reconciliation

Argo CD's main job is to make your cluster match your Git repo. It does this in a continuous loop called **reconciliation**.

---

```
      +-----------------+      +------------------+
----->| 1. Fetch & Diff |----->|  2. Is it Synced?  |----
|     +-----------------+      +--------+---------+     |
|                                       | Yes           |
|                                       | (Wait 3 mins) |
|      +-----------------+      +-------+----------+    |
------| 4. Apply to k8s |<-----|  3. OutOfSync?   |<---
      +-----------------+      +------------------+
```

1.  **Fetch & Diff:** Argo CD fetches the latest code from Git and compares it to the live state in the Kubernetes cluster.
2.  **Check Status:** It determines if the application is `Synced` or `OutOfSync`.
3.  **Wait or Act:** If `Synced`, it waits for 3 minutes (by default) and starts over. If `OutOfSync`, it proceeds to the sync phase.
4.  **Apply:** The manifests from Git are applied to the cluster to bring it to the desired state.

# 🏗️ Argo CD Architecture: How Everything is Scoped

Understanding the hierarchy and organization of resources in Argo CD.

---

# 📋 Projects: The Top-Level Organization

**AppProjects** are the highest level of organization in Argo CD.

**What Projects Control:**

- **Source Repositories:** Which Git repos can be used
- **Destination Clusters:** Which Kubernetes clusters apps can deploy to
- **Destination Namespaces:** Which namespaces apps can use
- **Resource Permissions:** What Kubernetes resources can be created
- **Roles & Access:** Who can manage applications in this project

**Think of Projects as:** Organizational boundaries that enforce security and governance policies.

---

# 🚀 Applications: The Deployment Units

**Applications** are the core deployment units that connect Git repositories to Kubernetes resources.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Git Repository:** Points to your source code and manifests
- **Target Path:** Specific directory in the repo (e.g., `k8s/overlays/prod`)
- **Target Revision:** Branch, tag, or commit (e.g., `main`, `v1.2.3`)
- **Destination:** Which cluster and namespace to deploy to

---

# 🚀 Applications: The Deployment Units

**Key Points:**

- Applications themselves live in the `argocd` namespace
- They deploy resources to target namespaces
- Each app belongs to exactly one project
- One Git path = One application

---

# 🎯 Namespace Scoping: Where Resources Live

Argo CD has a clear separation between control plane and workloads:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  argocd namespace (Control Plane)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • Argo CD components               │
│  • Application definitions          │
│  • AppProject definitions           │
│  • Configuration & Secrets          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓ deploys to
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Target Namespaces (Workloads)    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • Your application pods            │
│  • Services, ConfigMaps, etc.       │
│  • Can be any namespace             │
│  • Controlled by AppProject rules   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

# 🔐 Multi-Tenancy: Isolating Teams & Environments

Argo CD supports multi-tenancy through Projects and RBAC:

```
Production Project              Development Project
├── frontend-prod              ├── frontend-dev
├── backend-prod               ├── backend-dev
├── database-prod              └── experimental-app
└── monitoring-prod
     ↓ Can only deploy to            ↓ Can only deploy to
   prod-* namespaces              dev-* namespaces
```

**Benefits:**

- **Isolation:** Teams can't accidentally deploy to wrong environments
- **Security:** Different permissions for different projects
- **Governance:** Enforce policies per project (allowed repos, resources)
- **Scalability:** Organize hundreds of applications logically

---

# 📊 Resource Hierarchy Example

```
AppProject: "ecommerce"
├── Application: "frontend"
│   ├── Destination: namespace "ecom-frontend"
│   └── Resources: Deployment, Service, Ingress
├── Application: "backend-api"
│   ├── Destination: namespace "ecom-backend"
│   └── Resources: Deployment, Service, ConfigMap
└── Application: "database"
    ├── Destination: namespace "ecom-data"
    └── Resources: StatefulSet, Service, PVC
```

**Key Insights:**

- One project can contain multiple applications
- Each application can target different namespaces
- Applications are independent but can be grouped logically
- Resources within an app are managed as a unit

---

# 🧩 Kubernetes Resource Types in Argo CD

- **Secrets** - Sensitive data (passwords, certificates, API keys)
- **PersistentVolumes/PVCs** - Storage resources

---

# 🌐 Networking & Access Resources

**Service Resources:**

- **Services** - Internal load balancing and service discovery
- **Ingress** - External HTTP/HTTPS access and routing
- **NetworkPolicies** - Network security rules

**Access Control:**

- **ServiceAccounts** - Pod identity for API access
- **Roles/RoleBindings** - Namespace-scoped permissions
- **ClusterRoles/ClusterRoleBindings** - Cluster-wide permissions

---

# Sync Strategy: Manual vs. Automated

You control _when_ Argo CD applies changes.

| Manual Sync (Default)                                                            | Automated Sync                                                                    |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **You are in control.**                                                          | **Git is in control.**                                                            |
| Argo CD detects changes and marks the app as `OutOfSync`.                        | Argo CD detects changes and **immediately** starts syncing.                       |
| You must click "Sync" in the UI or run a CLI command.                            | No human intervention needed.                                                     |
| **Good for:** Production environments where you want a human to approve changes. | **Good for:** Development or staging environments where you want rapid iteration. |

# 🔧 Sync Options: Fine-Tuning Deployments

Argo CD gives you powerful options to control _how_ it syncs.

- **Prune Resources:** This is a critical feature. When enabled, Argo CD will **delete** resources from the cluster if they are removed from the Git repository. This prevents orphaned resources.

- **Dry Run:** You can perform a "dry run" sync to see what _would_ happen without actually changing anything. This is great for validating changes.

- **Sync Phases & Waves:** You can use annotations to control the order in which resources are synced. For example, you can ensure a database schema migration Job runs _before_ the application Deployment is updated.

---

# ❤️ Self-Healing vs. Auto-Sync

These two concepts are often confused but are fundamentally different.

- **Auto-Sync:** Syncs the cluster when there is a **new commit in Git**.

  - _Trigger:_ A change in the Git repository.
  - _Purpose:_ To apply **new, desired changes**.

- **Self-Healing:** Syncs the cluster when there is a **manual change in the cluster itself**.
  - _Trigger:_ A difference between the live state and the last-synced Git commit.
  - _Purpose:_ To **revert undesired changes** and enforce the Git state.

**Example:** If a developer uses `kubectl scale` to manually change the number of replicas, Self-Healing will automatically change it back.

---

# 🔄 Rollbacks: Safe and Easy Reversions

Because Git is your source of truth, rolling back is straightforward.

1.  **The Git-Native Way (Recommended):**

    - Use `git revert <commit-hash>` to create a new commit that undoes the previous one.
    - Push the new commit.
    - Argo CD will see this as a new change and automatically sync your cluster back to the previous state. This is fully auditable.

---

# Rollbacks: Safe and Easy Reversions

2.  **The Argo CD UI Way:**
    - The UI keeps a history of every commit that has been synced.
    - You can click "Rollback" on a previous deployment.
    - Argo CD will apply the manifests from that older commit.
    - **Warning:** This puts your cluster in a state that no longer matches the `HEAD` of your Git branch. It should be used for temporary emergencies only.

---

# 🩺 Health Checks: Is My Application Okay?

Argo CD goes beyond `kubectl` to determine if an application is truly healthy.

- **Built-in Logic:** It has smart health checks for most standard Kubernetes resources.

  - For a `Deployment`, it's not "Healthy" until the new replica set is fully rolled out and all its pods are running and available.
  - For a `Service`, it checks if it has a `LoadBalancer` IP (if applicable).

- **Custom Health Checks:** If you have custom resources (CRDs), you can write your own health checks in Lua to tell Argo CD how to understand their health status.

**Health Statuses:** `Healthy`, `Progressing`, `Degraded`, `Suspended`, `Missing`, `Unknown`.

---

# 📊 The Argo CD UI: Your GitOps Dashboard

Argo CD provides a powerful web interface to visualize and manage your applications.

![Argo CD UI](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/assets/application-ui.png)

- **A) Application Tiles:** One for each application, showing its real-time sync and health status.
- **B) Resource Tree:** Visualizes all the Kubernetes resources that make up your application and how they relate to each other.
- **C) Sync Status:** Clearly indicates if the live state matches the desired state in Git.
- **D) Health Status:** Shows the overall health of the application based on its components.

---
