# ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Basics

A High-Level Introduction to Container Orchestration

**‚è±Ô∏è Duration:** 20 minutes

---

# ü§î What is Kubernetes?

It's a system that **automates** running applications in containers.

- **Manages** deployment, scaling, and failures automatically.
- **Orchestrates** containers across a group of machines.
- Originally from Google, now the industry standard.
- Often called **K8s**.

---

# üí° The Core Philosophy: Immutable Infrastructure

A key mindset for understanding Kubernetes.

| Traditional (Mutable)                 | Modern (Immutable)                  |
| :------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------- |
| Servers are unique & manually managed | Instances are identical & automated |
| If one fails, you repair it           | If one fails, you replace it        |
| Leads to configuration drift          | Ensures consistency and reliability |

**Kubernetes is designed for an immutable approach.**

# üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture: The Cluster

A Kubernetes cluster is a set of machines, called **nodes**, that run your applications. It consists of two main parts:

- **Control Plane:** The brain üß†. It manages the cluster and makes decisions.
- **Nodes:** The workers üí™. They are machines (VMs or physical) that run your application containers.

---

The Control Plane manages the Nodes to run your applications.

```
+---------------------------------+
|         CONTROL PLANE           |
|  (The Brain: API, Scheduler)    |
+---------------------------------+
              |
              | Manages
              |
+-------------+-------------------+
|             |                   |
|   NODE 1    |   NODE 2          |   NODE ...
| (Worker)    | (Worker)          |  (Worker)
| - Pod       | - Pod             |  - Pod
| - Pod       | - Pod             |
+-------------+-------------------+
```

# üì¶ Pods: The Smallest Unit

A **Pod** is the smallest deployable object in Kubernetes.

- It's a wrapper around one or more containers.
- Containers in a Pod share the same network (IP address) and storage.
- **Pods are ephemeral (disposable).** They can be destroyed and replaced at any time.

---

# üì¶ Pod Diagram

A Pod can contain one or more containers that work together.

```
+---------------------------+
|          POD              |
|   (Single IP Address)     |
|                           |
| +----------+ +----------+ |
| | Your App | |  Logging | |
| | Container| | Sidecar  | |
| +----------+ +----------+ |
|                           |
+---------------------------+
```

# üìú The Declarative Model

In Kubernetes, you don't give commands. You **declare a desired state**.

**You tell Kubernetes _WHAT_ you want, not _HOW_ to do it.**

- **You write:** "I want 3 copies of my app running."
- **Kubernetes works to:** Make reality match your declaration.

This is the foundation of "self-healing" infrastructure.

---

# üöÄ Managing Pods: Deployments

You rarely create Pods directly. You use a **Deployment** to declare your desired state for them.

- A **Deployment** manages a set of identical Pods.
- **It ensures your desired state is met:**
  - If a Pod crashes, it creates a new one.
  - If a Node fails, it moves the Pods to a healthy Node.
- It handles **rolling updates** and **rollbacks** with zero downtime.

---

# üåê Exposing Pods: Services

A **Service** gives you a stable network endpoint for your unstable Pods.

- **Problem:** Pods are replaced often, so their IP addresses change. How can other apps find them?
- **Solution:** A **Service** provides a single, stable IP address and DNS name. It acts as a load balancer, sending traffic to the healthy Pods.

---

# üåê Deployment + Service Diagram

A Service directs traffic to the Pods managed by a Deployment.

```
                      +-----------+
                      |           |
Incoming Traffic ---> |  SERVICE  | ---> [Pod 1 (IP: 10.1.1.2)]
                      |(Stable IP)|
                      |           | ---> [Pod 2 (IP: 10.1.1.3)]
                      +-----------+
                        |
                        '---> [Pod 3 (IP: 10.1.1.4)]
```

The Service finds all Pods with a specific label (e.g., `app=my-api`).

# ü§î Why Use Kubernetes?

| Benefit          | How Kubernetes Achieves It                                      |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self-Healing** | Automatically restarts or replaces failed containers.           |
| **Scalability**  | Scale apps up or down easily, or even automatically.            |
| **Portability**  | Runs the same way on any cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) or on-premise. |
| **Efficiency**   | Packs containers smartly to maximize server resource usage.     |
| **Ecosystem**    | Huge community and thousands of tools built to work with it.    |

---

# ‚úÖ Summary: The Core Flow

1. You have a **Cluster** of **Nodes**.
2. You create a **Deployment** to declare your desired state.
   - _"I want 3 copies of my app container."_
3. The Deployment creates and manages **Pods** for you.
4. You create a **Service** to give your Pods a stable IP address.

This declarative workflow is the foundation of modern, resilient applications.
